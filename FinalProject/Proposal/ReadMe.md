#             Final Project Proposal

### Likely Title of the project
* Apollo.ai? Maybe after the Greek God of Music - it's all I can think of right now.

### Project proposal
* My project would be creating an algo that procedurally generates music based off of what it hears.

### The Deets 
* This'll be similar to the project I've been showing you these past couple of weeks (except now it'll be on C instead of Python). What the software will do is analyze a piece of music, take the essential parts of it (ie timbre, notes, note length, velocity, etc.) and improv based off that. You'll be able to run it in the terminal shell or (the easiest outcome I feel) something more collaborative like Google Colab. 

### Projected Outcome
* Good Outcome:
    * compiles
    * recognizes solo instrumentation
    * able to take music and play back a phrase. It doesn't have to be a good phrase, just has to be something.
    * It'll play up to ten seconds of music
* Better Outcome:
    * All of **Good Outcome**
    * It'll play something and sound *somewhat* decent
    * The audio quality won't be terrible
    * At least thirty seconds worth of music
* Best Outcome:
    * All of **Better Outcome**
    * It'll be hard to distinguish between the AI-created parts and the human reference
    * Recognizes multiple instruments and can actively make parts for each one (up to *n* instruments)

### The Next Steps
* To effectively execute this I'll have to make a program that can distinguish and analyze music and store them as values it can call upon later. I'll need to read up on some machine learning and AI-produced music algorithims.
