compare thee to a summer’s day? 
Thou art more lovely and more temperate. 
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, And summer’s day? 
Thou art more lovely and more lovely and more temperate. 
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of that fair from fair sometime declines, 
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed; 
But thy eternal summer shall not fade, 
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st, Nor lose possession of
